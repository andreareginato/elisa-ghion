    title: "Somatics & Contact Improvisation",
    description:
      "How do somatic practices — body scanning, breath work, Feldenkrais, Body-Mind Centering — transform the quality of contact? I explore the bridge between inner listening and relational movement, seeking a CI practice that begins from deep proprioceptive awareness.",

  },
  {
    title: "Landscape as Partner",
    description:
      "What happens when we dance with the environment rather than in it? Trees, slopes, wind, and water become co-creators. This research takes CI outdoors, investigating how terrain and natural forces shape our movement choices and expand our sense of partnership.",
    image: "/images/gallery-6.jpg",
  },
  {
    title: "Contact & Composition",
    description:
      "The fertile territory between free improvisation and composed performance. How do we bring compositional awareness — timing, space, narrative arc — into the improvisational encounter without losing its spontaneity and authenticity?",
    image: "/images/gallery-9.jpg",
  },
  {
    title: "Consent & Touch Ethics",
    description:
      "A practice of saying yes, no, and not yet with clarity and care. I research how consent frameworks can be woven into CI pedagogy, creating spaces where vulnerability and boundaries coexist, and where touch is always an invitation, never an assumption.",

  },
  {
    title: "Fluid Dynamics in Movement",
    description:
      "Inspired by the physics of water — flow, turbulence, viscosity, wave motion — this research applies fluid dynamics principles to partnering. How can we move like water with another body, finding seamless transitions and continuous dialogue?",
    image: "/images/gallery-7.jpg",
  },
  {
    title: "Gravity as Teacher",
    description:
      "Gravity is not an obstacle but our most reliable partner. This ongoing exploration investigates falling, yielding, and suspension as pathways to trust — both in ourselves and with others. The floor is where every dance begins.",
